# Image-Processing-and-Analysis-for-Grain-Size-Characterization-

This work provides a complicated image processing and analysis approach for the categorization of particles in microscope photographs. The recommended procedure combines editing, multi-stage processing, and photo file alteration to increase particle exposure. Particle segmentation and outline filtering procedures are employed to obtain significant features, and then a detailed analysis of particle sizes, locations, and aspect ratios is done,while a unique texture analysis using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) enhances understanding of particle composition. The technique, including K-Means labeling and contour analysis, offers a valuable framework for particle identification, applicable in biology, material science, and environmental monitoring.
